# Named Entity Recognition

## AIM

To develop an LSTM-based model for recognizing the named entities in the text.

## Problem Statement and Dataset

## Neural Network Model

Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS

##1: Import the necessary packages.

##2: Read the dataset and fill the null values using forward fill.

##3: Create a list of words and tags. Also find the number of unique words and tags in the dataset.

##4: Create a dictionary for the words and their Index values. Repeat the same for the tags as well.

##5: We done this by padding the sequences and also to acheive the same length of input data.

##6: We build the model using Input, Embedding, Bidirectional LSTM, Spatial Dropout, Time Distributed Dense Layers.

##7: We compile the model to fit the train sets and validation sets.
